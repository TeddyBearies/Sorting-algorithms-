Bubble Sort
This method keeps comparing two numbers next to each other and switches them if they’re in the wrong order. After every full pass, more numbers end up in the right place. It’s one of the easiest sorting algorithms to understand, but not very fast when there are many elements.

Insertion Sort
Insertion sort builds the sorted list step by step. It takes one number at a time and places it where it belongs among the previous ones. It works well when the list is already almost sorted, but it can be slow for large data sets.

Selection Sort
This method looks through the list, finds the smallest number, and puts it at the beginning. Then it repeats the same thing for the rest of the list until everything is sorted. It’s simple and easy to follow, but it also takes a lot of comparisons.

Quick Sort
Quick sort chooses one number as a pivot and splits the list into two parts — smaller numbers on one side and larger ones on the other. Then it sorts both sides in the same way until the whole list is in order. It’s usually faster than the others, especially for big lists.
